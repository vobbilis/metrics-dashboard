description: "Intensive task clarification using AskUserQuestion - use when starting any non-trivial task"
---

**ultrathink** - Take a deep breath. We're not here to write code. We're here to make a dent in the universe.

## The Vision
Clarity creates inevitability. Every question should narrow the path to truth.

## Your Work, Step by Step
1. **Task understanding**: Identify the type of work.
2. **Scope definition**: Bound the change clearly.
3. **Technical decisions**: Surface approach preferences.
4. **Quality requirements**: Define tests/docs expectations.
5. **Confirm**: Summarize and proceed only when clear.

## Ultrathink Principles in Practice
- **Think Different**: Challenge implicit assumptions.
- **Obsess Over Details**: Capture constraints precisely.
- **Plan Like Da Vinci**: Build the question set first.
- **Craft, Don't Code**: Ask fewer, better questions.
- **Iterate Relentlessly**: Refine after answers.
- **Simplify Ruthlessly**: Remove nonessential questions.

# Deep Clarification Skill

This skill provides patterns for intensive task clarification using Claude's native `AskUserQuestion` tool.

## When to Use

**ALWAYS use this skill when:**
- Starting any new feature implementation
- The task could be interpreted multiple ways
- There are architectural decisions to make
- The scope is not 100% clear
- The user's request is brief or high-level

## Clarification Framework

### Phase 1: Task Understanding

Ask about the fundamental nature of the task:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "What type of work is this?"
      header: "Task Type"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "New Feature"
          description: "Adding new functionality that doesn't exist"
        - label: "Enhancement"
          description: "Improving existing functionality"
        - label: "Bug Fix"
          description: "Correcting incorrect behavior"
        - label: "Refactoring"
          description: "Improving code without changing behavior"
```

### Phase 2: Scope Definition

Clarify the boundaries:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "What is the scope of this change?"
      header: "Scope"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "Single file"
          description: "Changes confined to one file"
        - label: "Single module/feature"
          description: "Changes within one logical area"
        - label: "Cross-cutting"
          description: "Changes spanning multiple areas"
        - label: "System-wide"
          description: "Architectural changes"
```

### Phase 3: Technical Decisions

For implementation choices:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "Do you have preferences for the implementation approach?"
      header: "Approach"
      multiSelect: true
      options:
        - label: "Follow existing patterns (Recommended)"
          description: "Match codebase conventions"
        - label: "Introduce new pattern"
          description: "Implement a better approach"
        - label: "Minimal changes"
          description: "Smallest possible diff"
        - label: "Comprehensive solution"
          description: "Full implementation with all edge cases"
```

### Phase 4: Quality Requirements

Clarify expectations:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "What quality gates apply?"
      header: "Quality"
      multiSelect: true
      options:
        - label: "Unit tests required"
          description: "Add comprehensive unit tests"
        - label: "Integration tests required"
          description: "Add integration/e2e tests"
        - label: "Documentation required"
          description: "Add/update documentation"

        - label: "Legacy required"
          description: "Must support IE11 or older"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Ask in batches of 2-4 questions** - Don't overwhelm with 10 questions at once
2. **MUST_HAVE first** - Get critical answers before nice-to-haves
3. **Provide defaults** - Mark recommended options clearly
4. **Context-aware** - Skip questions you can answer from codebase
5. **Summarize understanding** - Confirm before proceeding

## Phase 5: Socratic Design Exploration (v2.42)

**Origin:** superpowers pattern - explore alternatives before committing.

For non-trivial architectural decisions, ALWAYS present alternatives:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "I've identified multiple approaches. Which direction do you prefer?"
      header: "Design Choice"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "Option A (Recommended)"
          description: "[Approach A] - Trade-off: [pros/cons]"
        - label: "Option B"
          description: "[Approach B] - Trade-off: [pros/cons]"
        - label: "Option C"
          description: "[Approach C] - Trade-off: [pros/cons]"
```

### When to Use Socratic Exploration

**MANDATORY when:**
- Adding new architectural patterns
- Choosing between libraries/frameworks
- Designing data models with multiple valid approaches
- Cross-cutting changes affecting 3+ modules

**Template for Exploration:**

```markdown
## Design Exploration: [Feature Name]

### Option A: [Name]
**Approach:** [Brief description]
**Pros:**
- [Pro 1]
- [Pro 2]
**Cons:**
- [Con 1]
- [Con 2]
**Best for:** [Use case]

### Option B: [Name]
**Approach:** [Brief description]
**Pros:**
- [Pro 1]
- [Pro 2]
**Cons:**
- [Con 1]
- [Con 2]
**Best for:** [Use case]

### Option C: [Name]
[Same structure]

### Recommendation
I recommend **Option [X]** because [justification based on project context].

Do you agree, or would you prefer a different approach?
```

### Example: Database Pattern Choice

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "For the user activity log, which storage pattern?"
      header: "Storage"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "Event Sourcing (Recommended)"
          description: "Full audit trail, replay capability. More complex queries."
        - label: "Traditional CRUD"
          description: "Simple queries, less storage. No history replay."
        - label: "Hybrid"
          description: "CRUD + event log. Balance of both. More maintenance."
```

## Integration

After clarification is complete:

1. **Summarize** all answers in a structured format
2. **Present design alternatives** if architectural decisions exist (Phase 5)
3. **Classify** the task complexity (1-10)
4. **Enter Plan Mode** for non-trivial tasks
5. **Proceed** only when user confirms understanding is correct
