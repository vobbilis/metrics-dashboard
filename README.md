# Aigile

Multi-agent orchestration pipelines for GitHub Copilot — plan, build, review, and ship with specialized AI agents working in concert.

**[Live Documentation →](https://vobbilis.github.io/aigile/)**

## What Is This?

Aigile is a set of reusable Copilot-native pipelines that turn a single prompt into fully orchestrated, multi-agent software delivery. Describe a feature or a bug in plain English; the system plans the work, implements it with TDD, validates every step, runs adversarial code review, and opens a PR — all without leaving VS Code.

The pipelines are **project-agnostic**. Edit one config file (`.github/project.json`) to point them at any tech stack — Python, TypeScript, Java, Go, or anything else.

## Tests

Step-by-step tests to verify each pipeline end-to-end. See **[docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)** for full details.

## Try It Yourself

This repo includes a **working full-stack app** (FastAPI backend + React/TypeScript frontend) built entirely using the aigile pipelines. It's a metrics dashboard — simple enough to understand quickly, complex enough to exercise every pipeline feature.

The best way to learn how the pipelines work is to **run them against this project**. Open the repo in VS Code, switch Copilot Chat to Agent mode, and try these prompts:

### Feature Prompts (`/plan_to_build`)

```
/plan_to_build "add a sparkline chart to MetricCard showing the last 10 values"
```
```
/plan_to_build "add a metric history endpoint GET /metrics/{name}/history with pagination"
```
```
/plan_to_build "add a dark mode toggle that persists to localStorage"
```
```
/plan_to_build "add metric tags filtering — let users filter the dashboard by tag key/value"
```

### Bug Fix Prompts (`/bug_to_pr`)

```
/bug_to_pr "the delete button returns success but the metric card doesn't disappear until the next poll"
```
```
/bug_to_pr "posting a metric with an empty name returns 500 instead of 422 validation error"
```
```
/bug_to_pr "the frontend polling interval resets when switching between filtered and unfiltered views"
```

### What to Watch For

- **`/plan_to_build`** creates a spec in `specs/`, then say `execute the plan` to watch builder + validator agents take turns implementing each task with TDD
- **`/bug_to_pr`** runs the full 6-phase lifecycle — triage, plan, build, PR, adversarial review, merge — all from a single prompt
- **Hooks fire automatically** — every file write triggers lint/typecheck validation in real time
- **Crash recovery works** — if a pipeline stops mid-run, say `resume` and it picks up from the last checkpoint
